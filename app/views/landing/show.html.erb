      <p>According to the U.S. Treasury, the motto E pluribus unum was first used on U.S. coinage in 1795, when the reverse of the half-eagle ($5 gold) coin presented the main features of the Great Seal of the United States. E pluribus unum is inscribed on the Great Seal's scroll. The motto was added to certain silver coins in 1798, and soon appeared on all of the coins made out of precious metals (gold and silver).</p>

        “Eileen is a very compassionate and intuitive coach. She is committed to my health journey and doesn’t give up on me – even when I might want to give up on myself. Together we continue to explore what works. Eileen shares with me valuable resources and inspirational messages that keep me going!” <strong>- Vicky Wegman</strong>

        “There are so many yoga teachers out there these days.  How can I distinguish a good one?  I found one today!   After the first 1-hour lesson, I decided she is the best and the yoga instructor I have been looking for.  Why?  She is patient, articulate, authentic, expressive, caring and passionate in her teaching… I feel all of the above when I had my yoga sessions with Eileen Atlasov.  At the end of her classes, I walked away with what I wanted when I walked into the class… peacefulness, calmness, relaxation and a clear mind.  Thank, Eileen… You are the Best!” <strong>- Maisy Young</strong>

        “I started practicing yoga with a small group of YouTube yoga teachers and first met Eileen when I decided to end my purely solo yoga-experience and try out a public class. Eileen was both patient and welcoming, which has made her weekend group classes something I look forward to attending. I also ended up scheduling some one-on-one sessions to address my concerns that my solo-with-YouTube-time had helped me habituate bad habits that I wanted to identify and address. The one-on-one sessions were a great opportunity to ask specific questions about poses, breathing, and philosophy without feeling like I was disrupting a group and to focus specifically on areas that I was interested in. It’s been refreshing to practice yoga with someone who is at once full of practical knowledge, positive energy and has a willingness to share both. Highly recommended!” <strong>- Brian Elliot</strong>
