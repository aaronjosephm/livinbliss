      <p>My yoga journey began at the age of 9 years old. I began by practicing Bikram Yoga with my mother about 3 times/week.</p>
      <p>Having a yoga practice throughout my teenage years gave me the ability to learn so much more about my mind and body. I was able to concentrate better at school, and became so much more in tune with myself. Once I turned 18 and left to live abroad, I became more and more attracted to Hatha Yoga.</p>
      <p>I also dived into the world of mindfulness and meditation, which gave me the tools to take my practice off the mat and apply yoga to every part of my life.</p>
      <p>In early 2016 I received my 200 hour Hatha Yoga Teaching Certification at the Sivananda Ashram in Madurai, India. I was 19 years old at the time, and my passion for yoga grew FAST. In June of 2018, I because a certified children's yoga teacher, and then in July I became a certified Yin yoga teacher under Bernie Clark. </p>

      <p>In addition to my public preschool classes, I offer one-one at-home children's yoga practices as well as group events such as birthday parties and weekly family yoga. I absolutely love working with children ages 3-7, and have seen such magic happen from just 20 minutes of yoga for them. I am comfortable teaching up to 12 childrens at a time.
