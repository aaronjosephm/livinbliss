      <p>My yoga journey began at the age of 9 years old. I began by practicing Bikram Yoga with my mother about 3 times/week.</p>
      <p>Having a yoga practice throughout my teenage years gave me the ability to learn so much more about my mind and body. I was able to concentrate better at school, and became so much more in tune with myself. Once I turned 18 and left to live abroad, I became more and more attracted to Hatha Yoga.</p>
      <p>I also dived into the world of mindfulness and meditation, which gave me the tools to take my practice off the mat and apply yoga to every part of my life.</p>
      <p>In early 2016 I received my 200 hour Hatha Yoga Teaching Certification at the Sivananda Ashram in Madurai, India. I was 19 years old at the time, and my passion for yoga grew FAST. In June of 2018, I because a certified children's yoga teacher, and then in July I became a certified Yin yoga teacher under Bernie Clark. </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 100px; ">“The physical practice of yoga gifts us in healing so many different internal and external ailments that we experience daily due to bad posture, lack of movement, stress, and diet. The spiritual aspect of yoga enables us to develop alignment between our mind, body, and breath. It reminds us that we already possess everything we need in order to take better care of ourselves. It brings us into the present moment which can alleviate emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.” <strong>- Eileen Atlasov</strong></p>

        <p>“I had initially met Eileen, who was doing weekend "Hatha Yoga in the Park" sessions every Saturday and Sunday morning.  I am an early riser, and I tried to go both mornings, other than when I was traveling.  I have always loved Hatha Yoga, which helps you to focus on your technique and to hold positions.  Eileen was an excellent coach for all of us, and I knew that attending regular yoga, in addition to my usual hiking and Pilates, was really helping me.  At 70 years old, I wanted to maintain my strength, balance, and flexibility.  Yoga is an excellent practice to support all 3 of those goals.  Ten years previously, I was diagnosed with celiac disease, and it had negatively affected my bone density due to not digesting my food.  So, another obvious goal with yoga is to help with my osteoporosis and increase my bone density.  To help with that, Eileen advised me to switch to plant-based calcium, which is more easily digested, which I happily did.</p>

        <p>In addition to my weekend yoga, I signed up with weekly one-on-one yoga sessions with Eileen.  We mostly did Hatha yoga, although we occasionally did some restorative when I needed it.  She really helped me to be more calm and focus, and I knew I was increasing my strength and flexibility.  I'm still working on the balance, which is tough for me, but I will hopefully get there.  After several months with Eileen, I fell at home and severely broke my wrist.  I obviously couldn't do Hatha, so instead we did Restorative yoga, and as my strength increased we added more poses so I could continue to work on my yoga goals.  She was very patient with me and knew alternative positions I could use when I couldn't do others.  Spending quality yoga time with her enriched and strengthened me, and I am truly grateful for her guidance and calming mantras and meditations.  She is truly an inspiration.</p>

        <p>Much thanks, Eileen, for everything!” <strong>- Lesley Birch</strong></p>

Eileen helps you feel welcomed in her class, regardless of your yoga skill level, and will meet you where you're at. She creates an intimate class environment, where she invites you to reflect on and challenge yourself - giving you an opportunity to leave an hour later as a better person, physically and emotionally.”
