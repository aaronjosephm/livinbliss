      <p>My yoga journey began at the age of 9 years old. I began by practicing Bikram Yoga with my mother about 3 times/week.</p>
      <p>Having a yoga practice throughout my teenage years gave me the ability to learn so much more about my mind and body. I was able to concentrate better at school, and became so much more in tune with myself. Once I turned 18 and left to live abroad, I became more and more attracted to Hatha Yoga.</p>
      <p>I also dived into the world of mindfulness and meditation, which gave me the tools to take my practice off the mat and apply yoga to every part of my life.</p>
      <p>In early 2016 I received my 200 hour Hatha Yoga Teaching Certification at the Sivananda Ashram in Madurai, India. I was 19 years old at the time, and my passion for yoga grew FAST. In June of 2018, I because a certified children's yoga teacher, and then in July I became a certified Yin yoga teacher under Bernie Clark. </p>

      <p>I provide 60-90 minute at-home private yoga classes. If you don't have enough time or feel self-conscious in a studio setting, I would be happy to work with you in the comfort of your own home. You would receive my undivided attention and we would focus on specific aches, pains, and internal/external ailments you might be experiencing. We can also focus on aspects of yoga like flexibility, strength, yoga fundamentals, balance, or inversions.
      </p>
      <p>Having a consistent yoga practice since childhood has been the biggest gift in my life and I want to share that gift with you!</p>
