      <p><strong>My yoga journey began at the age of 9 years old.</strong> I began by practicing Bikram Yoga with my mother about 3 times/week.</p>
      <p>Having a Bikram yoga practice throughout my teenage years was not only a great supplement to the sports I did growing up, but was also a an early gateway into my mind and body. I was able to concentrate better at school, and became so much more in tune with my emotional and physical body. Once I turned 18 and left to live abroad, I became more curious about other styles of yoga such as traditional hatha and ashtanga.</p>
      <p>During my first trip to Thailand, the world of mindfulness and meditation introduced itself to me, and gave me the tools to take my practice off the mat and start to see how yoga really applies to every moment of every day.</p>
      <p>In early 2016 I received my 200 hour Hatha Yoga Teaching Certification at Sivananda Ashram in Madurai, India. I was 19 years old at the time, and my passion for yoga grew QUICKLY. Practicing on the rooftops of barely standing buildings, right by the ganges river, and in the Himalayan mountain villages, the physical practice consumed 6 months of my life. Fast forward to 2018, I became a certified children's yoga teacher at Yoga Garden, San Francisco, and then soon after words traveled to Vancouver to study Yin Yoga from the Yin master himself - Bernie Clark. </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 100px; "><strong>“The physical practice of yoga gifts us in healing so many different internal and external ailments that we experience daily due to bad posture, lack of movement, stress, and diet. The spiritual aspect of yoga enables us to develop alignment between our mind, body, and breath. It reminds us that we already possess everything we need in order to take better care of ourselves. It brings us into the present moment which can alleviate emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.” - Eileen Atlasov</strong></p>

      <p><strong>1 year ago</strong>, I stepped into the gym anxious, confused, and overwhelmed. I knew I wanted to lose fat, gain muscle, run longer, and - god-willing - be able to do 1 pullup. Thankfully, I was taken under the wing of a personal trainer who invited me to his group Bootcamp classes which I attended 3/week for a year. 1 years later, I have achieved all of those goals and on top of that have developed a full on addiction to pushing myself out of my comfort zone on a daily basis. </p>
      <p>Similar to yoga, the gym has helped me improve my relationship to my body and to the food I choose to put into it. It has become my safe haven, my escape, my community. Unlike yoga though, working out offers me an opportunity to sweat and suffer just enough to gain the confidence to face adversity in other aspects of my life. I love the way my body looks and feels now, but more than anything I am thankful for the trainer that never stopped believing me and pushing me toward my potential. That is why I decided to become a NASM certified personal trainer and pass on the same gift to others.</p>
      <p>I now work with clients at Stanford University as well as training clients in the comfort of their own home. </p>

      <p><strong>My Personal Training Philosophy:</strong></p>
      <p>Exercise tends to have a negative connotation. I believe that instead of calling it exercise, it should be called adult play - because that’s truly what it is! I am all about pushing your to challenge yourself, but also find it extremely important to facilitate a space of playfulness. I want you to see each day as a new opportunity to set goals, get moving, and feel/look better!</p>

                  <p>I had initially met Eileen, who was doing weekend "Hatha Yoga in the Park" sessions every Saturday and Sunday morning. Eileen was an excellent coach for all of us. I was diagnosed with celiac disease, so, another obvious goal with yoga is to help with my osteoporosis and increase my bone density.</p>   

                  <p>In addition to weekend yoga, I signed up with weekly one-on-one yoga sessions with Eileen.  We mostly did Hatha yoga, although we occasionally did some restorative when I needed it.  She really helped me to be more calm and focus, and I knew I was increasing my strength and flexibility. She was very patient with me and knew alternative positions I could use when I couldn't do others. Spending quality yoga time with her enriched and strengthened me, and I am truly grateful for her guidance and calming mantras and meditations.  She is truly an inspiration.</p>

                  <p>Much thanks, Eileen, for everything!” <strong>- Lesley Birch</strong></p>

                  “My guided meditation sessions with Eileen became my favorite part of the day. She helped me challenge myself to stay present throughout the progressively longer sessions. She taught me a variety of techniques to use to calm my mind as well as tips to do when your mind started to wander again.  I loved her idea of imagining your thoughts as cars driving by and seeing them exit  to return you to your still state of mind. Her voice is so soothing as well!”

                  Eileen conducts her classes in a tempo that is easy for beginners to follow, yet can be challenging even for seasoned practitioners like myself. The most enjoyable moments about Eileen's class for me was at the end when she gave adjustments during savasana. The adjustments made me feel super rejuvenated afterwards. For anyone that is interested, I would definitely recommend Eileen’s yoga classes.”
